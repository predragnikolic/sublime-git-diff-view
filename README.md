### Installation

### Instructions

The default keybinding for toggling the view is `ctrl+shift+g`(Linux) or `alt+shift+g`(Mac).
The git view won't open if there are no git changes.

Inside the `Git Status` view you can use the following keybinds:

```
  a - stage/unstage a file
  d - dismiss changes to a file
  g - go to a file
```

Type of modification will be shown in the git status, next to the file name.
Here is a list of the types:

```
    ?? - Untracked
     A - Added
     M - Modified
     D - Deleted
     R - Renamed
     C - Copied
    UU - Unmerged(Conflict)
```

### Note

### Configuration
